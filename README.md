**Description:** Summer project I built with @patrick7kelly.

**Background:** Wanted a solution for always looking up the prices of various cryptos over the summer of 2014.

**Features:** Can swap out data for multiple exchanges, progressive data loading (maybe?), and orderbook views.

**Notes:** Unfortunately no videos of this project exist. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
